# Simple Shell

Simple Shell is a basic UNIX command-line interpreter written in C. It provides a minimalistic interface for executing commands and built-in functions, suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced shell implementations.

## Features

- Interactive mode: Prompt user for commands and execute them.
- Non-interactive mode: Read commands from a stream (e.g., file or another program's output) and execute them.
- Command line arguments: Support for commands with arguments.
- Built-in functions:
  - `exit`: Terminate the shell.
  - `env`: Print the current environment variables.
- PATH handling: Search for executables in the PATH environment variable.
- Error handling: Proper handling of errors and edge cases.
