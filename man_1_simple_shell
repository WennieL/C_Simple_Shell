Simple Shell(1) - A basic UNIX command-line interpreter

NAME                  simple-shell - a simple UNIX command-line interpreter

SYNOPSIS              hsh

DESCRIPTION           simple-shell is a basic command-line interpreter written in C. 
                      It provides a minimalistic interface for executing commands and built-in functions. 
                      It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.

OPTIONS               There are no command-line options for simple-shell.

USAGE                 To run simple-shell in interactive mode, simply execute the compiled binary:
                      $ ./hsh       

                      In interactive mode, you will be prompted with a `$` symbol to enter commands. 
                      Type your commands and press Enter to execute them. To exit the shell, type `exit`.

                      To run simple-shell in non-interactive mode, provide input from a stream:
                      $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh

Built-in Commands     `exit`: Terminate the shell.
                      `env`: Print the current environment variables.

RETURN VALUE          simple-shell  returns 0 upon successful execution of commands or built-in functions. 
                      If an error occurs, it returns a non-zero exit status.

EXAMPLES              1. Run the shell in interactive mode:
                          
                          $ ./hsh
                          ($) /bin/ls
                          hsh main.c shell.c
                          ($)
                          ($) exit
                          $

                      2. Run the shell in non-interactive mode:
                          
                          $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
                          hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
                          $
                          $ cat test_ls_2
                          /bin/ls
                          /bin/ls
                          $
                          $ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
                          hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
                          hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
                          $
